When most people think of bamboo, their minds jump to Asia, but there are actually many species of bamboo that are native to North and South America. There are even a few species that grow naturally in the United States.

The focus of my master's degree research project was one of these American bamboos called River cane. Scientifically, its name is <em>Arunindaria gigantea</em>, but naming and placing this plant in the family tree of bamboos has caused a surprising amount of debate over the last 200 years. Luckily my research sidestepped the taxonomy of River cane and focused on something more concrete.

The problem really started about 500 years ago, and it involves Native American farmland, European diseases, disasterous wild pigs, and lots and lots of fire. But to make a long story short, River cane is fighting a losing battle and is becoming endangered. Lots of conservationists, limnologists, ecologists, and other scientists have noticed and are trying to help. Right now these people agree that we should be planting more River cane, and that leads to my research questions. Where are we going to get more of this rare plant and how do we know how much more River cane is enough?
