Jimsonweed (*Datura stramonium*) is a weedy plant in the nightshade family notable for its production of many useful medicinal or insecticidal compounds like the tropane alkaloids [hyoscyamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscyamine) and [atropine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine). The plant was historically used as a model organism to answer questions regarding aneuploidy and polyplody, and the [first haploid flowering plant reported](http://www.doi.org/10.1126/science.55.1433.646) was *D. stramonium*.

Important for my dissertation research though is the fact that plants in the genus *Datura* produce a dry, dehiscent capsule, superfically similar to that of tobacco. *Datura* is actually more closely related to plants that produce a fleshy berry, such as tomato, instead of a dry capsule. This means that in terms of fruit type, *Datura* has undergone an evolutionary reversal, and this reversal presents an interesting opportunity to further understand the genetic basis of fruit evolution by comparing the dry fruit of *Datura* with the dry (but distantly related) fruit of tobacco and the closely related (but fleshy) fruit of tomato.

Compared to tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*) and tobacco (*Nicotiana spp.*), plants in the genus *Datura* lack many of the molecular and genetic tools that enable research. Chief among these genetic tools is a sequenced reference genome, which would ease the application of CRISPR-based gene knockouts (and many other experiments).

With guidance from [Amy Litt](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/amylitt) and [Jason Stajich](http://lab.stajich.org/home/welcome/) I am sequencing, assembling, and annotating the genome of *Datura stramonium* with a combination of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies.
