description: "On the origins of fleshy fruits in the nightshade family"

Throughout the evolution of flowering plants (angiosperms) there have been many evolutionary transitions from an ancestral dry fruit to a more derived flesy fruit. My current research examines the genetic mechanisms behind this economically and ecologically important plant trait in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae).

In nightshades, early diverging species like tobacco or petunia generally have a dry, dehiscent, capsular fruit, while later-diverging species like tomato or pepper have an edible, fleshy berry. Along with another grad student in [Amy Litt's](https://plantbiology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/litt.html) lab at UCR, we are investigating the developmental and evolutionary basis of dry vs fleshy fruits. My research specifically focuses on the dry-fruited species desert tobacco (<em>Nicotiana obtusifolia</em>) and aims to determine the role transcriptional networks involving homologs of the <em>Arabidopsis</em> transcription factor <em>FRUITFULL</em>.

I am also involved in some early work extending this project into other species in the nightshade family with different evolutionary origins of dry and fleshy fruits. This includes the genus <em>Datura</em>, which has reverted back to a dry-fruit, and the genera <em>Cestrum</em> and <em>Brunfelsia</em>, which have both independently evolved fleshy berries.

Currently, this project has one phenomenal undergraduate student working on it with me, as well as a number of very skilled past undergraduate 'alumni'.
