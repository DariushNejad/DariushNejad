<p>Hi, I'm Alex Rajewski, a PhD student at the University of California, Riverside. Originally from Topeka, KS, I got a bachelor's degree in Iowa at Drake University, then worked in Germany for a year before getting my master's degree at the University of Georgia. When not buried in botany, I'm usually buried in an old sci-fi novel or a very very dark beer.</p>
