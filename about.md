<p> I am a M.S. candidate in the Department of Botany and Plant Sciences at University of California, Riverside. My research is focused on understanding the role of protein phosphorylation for the maintenance of stem cells located on the shoot apical meristem in plants. When uncovering the mysteries of plant development, I spend my time homesteading, sipping on ciders or playing video games.  
I'll be graduating with my Masters the Summer of 2020 and transitioning into industry where I hope to aplly my skills towards a career in Synthetic Biology. I am open to all expereince and can work in a commercial, academic or government setting. </p>
